# Bot to punch a clock

In order not to have to log into the company's portal every day, I had the idea of creating a script that does this, preventing me from forgetting to punch in the clock.

## Goals

- [x] Create a script to log into the company portal;
- [x] Create a script to hit the spot;
- [x] Check if it's a business day (if I have work on that day);
- [x] Notify status (has been hit or not) on desktop:
  - [x] Test on Ubuntu (20.04);
  - [ ] Test on Windows;
  - [ ] Test on MacOS;
- [x] Create exception handling;
- [x] Try at least 3 times if there is an error;
- [ ] Create a script (cron) to boot at the start and end times of the workday.

### Extra Goals

- [ ] Add test;
- [ ] Add Eslint and Prettier;
- [ ] Add commit pattern and validation before commit and push;
- [ ] Refactor to TypeScript;
- [ ] Leave the hit point script generic;
- [ ] Create installer (.deb, .exe ...);
- [ ] Create interface for configuration (Update image, login, pass ...).

## Comments

The script to log in and time out was developed according to the login of the company's portal I'm working with. Most likely it will be necessary to update the script if the portal changes.

To update the image that appears in the notification you just need to update the `assets/icon1.jpg`.
